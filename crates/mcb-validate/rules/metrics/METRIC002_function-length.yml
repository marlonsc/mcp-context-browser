description: |
  Enforces a maximum line count for functions.
  Long functions are harder to understand and maintain.

rationale: |
  Functions exceeding the line limit often do too much and should
  be broken down into smaller, single-purpose functions that are
  easier to test and reason about.

  function_length:
    max: 50

fixes:
  - type: refactor
    pattern: "Extract methods"
    message: "Extract logical sections into separate methods"
  - type: refactor
    pattern: "Single responsibility"
    message: "Ensure each function has a single responsibility"
